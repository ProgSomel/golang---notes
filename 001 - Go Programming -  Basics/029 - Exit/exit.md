# 029 - Exit
In Go Programming, OS.exit is a function that terminates the program immediately with the given status code. It is usefull for situation where you need to halt the execution of the program completely, without deferring any function or performing any clean up operaions.

When OS.exit is called, it stops the program execution immediately, and any deferred functions registered using defer will not be executed, and the function takes an integer argument which represents the status code returned to the operating system.

Conventionally, a status code of zero indicated successful completion, while any non-zero status code indicates an error or abnormal termination.

It bypasses the normal defer, panic, and recover mechanisms.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main(){
	fmt.Println("Starting the main function");
	//? Exit with status code of 1
	os.Exit(1)

	//? This will never be executed
	fmt.Println("End of main function");

}
```
```bash
Starting the main function
exit status 1
```

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main(){
	defer fmt.Println("Deferred Function")
	fmt.Println("Starting the main function");
	//? Exit with status code of 1
	os.Exit(1)

	//? This will never be executed
	fmt.Println("End of main function");

}
```
```bash
Starting the main function
exit status 1
```

## Practical Use Cases
- Error Handling
- Termination Conditions
- Exit Codes

## Best Practices
- Avoid Deferred Actions
- Status Codes(meaningful code, Zero for success and non-zero for error Conditions, is for 
  specific error Conditions)
- Avoid Abusive Use(it should be used sparingly and only when truly necessary, such as 
  in unrecoverable error scenariors or when the program must stop immediately)

In conclusion, OS.exit provides a straightforward mechanisms to terminate the execution of a Go program with a specific exit code.
